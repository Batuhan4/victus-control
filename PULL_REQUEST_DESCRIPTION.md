# 🔧 Comprehensive Code Review and Critical Fixes

## Summary
This pull request addresses multiple critical issues found during a comprehensive code review of the victus-control project. The fixes improve reliability, security, memory management, and error handling across the entire codebase.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

### Backend Improvements
- **Signal Handling**: Added proper SIGTERM/SIGINT handling for graceful shutdown
- **Memory Management**: Fixed socket cleanup and resource management
- **Thread Safety**: Enhanced fan control thread management with proper error checking
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error checking for all file operations
- **Missing Headers**: Added essential headers (`cstring`, `cerrno`, `signal.h`)

### Frontend Improvements
- **Memory Management**: Fixed smart pointer consistency between header and implementation
- **GTK Usage**: Improved main loop memory management and error handling
- **Socket Client**: Enhanced connection handling and error recovery
- **Error Validation**: Added proper error response validation in UI components

### Build System
- **Dependencies**: Added missing thread dependencies to meson.build files
- **Linking**: Ensured proper pthread linking for multi-threaded components

### Installation Script
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error checking for all installation steps
- **Validation**: Implemented proper validation for critical system operations
- **User Experience**: Improved error messages and failure handling

## 📋 Detailed Changes

### Backend (`backend/src/`)
- `main.cpp`: Added signal handlers, graceful shutdown, socket cleanup
- `fan.cpp`: Enhanced thread safety, file operation error checking
- `keyboard.cpp`: Added missing headers, improved error handling

### Frontend (`frontend/src/`)
- `main.cpp`: Fixed memory management, improved error handling
- `main.hpp`: Fixed smart pointer consistency
- `socket.cpp`: Enhanced connection handling, better error reporting
- `fan.cpp`: Added error response validation

### Build Files
- `backend/meson.build`: Added thread dependency
- `frontend/meson.build`: Added thread dependency

### Installation
- `install.sh`: Comprehensive error handling and validation

## 🛡️ Security Improvements
- Enhanced input validation for fan modes
- Better error handling to prevent information disclosure
- Improved resource cleanup to prevent leaks

## ⚡ Performance Improvements
- More efficient error handling paths
- Reduced unnecessary system calls
- Better memory management

## 🔄 Reliability Improvements
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Better error recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations
1. Test graceful shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGINT
2. Verify error handling with hardware disconnection
3. Test installation script with various failure scenarios
4. Validate thread safety under concurrent access
5. Test socket connection recovery mechanisms

## 📊 Impact Assessment
- **High Impact**: Signal handling, memory management, build dependencies
- **Medium Impact**: Error handling, thread safety
- **Low Impact**: Logging improvements, code consistency

## ✅ Backward Compatibility
All fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the codebase quality.
