# Major Security and Stability Improvements for Victus Control

## Summary

This pull request addresses critical security vulnerabilities, stability issues, and performance problems identified in a comprehensive code review. The changes significantly improve the robustness, security, and user experience of the Victus Control application.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Command Injection Fix**: Removed shell script execution and replaced with direct sysfs writes
- **Input Validation**: Added comprehensive validation for all user inputs (fan speeds, RGB values, brightness)
- **Removed NOPASSWD sudo**: Eliminated the need for passwordless sudo by using proper permissions

### 2. **Memory and Resource Management**
- Fixed missing includes (`cstring`, `cerrno`) that could cause compilation issues
- Implemented proper thread lifecycle management with graceful shutdown
- Added cleanup handlers for all resources
- Fixed memory leaks in texture loading

### 3. **Race Conditions**
- Fixed fan control race condition by ensuring manual mode is set before speed changes
- Added proper synchronization for shared state access
- Implemented thread-safe caching mechanisms

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive logging infrastructure with different log levels
- Improved error messages and user feedback
- Added proper error recovery mechanisms

## New Features

### 1. **Configuration Management**
- Created `config.hpp` with all constants centralized
- Removed magic numbers throughout the codebase
- Made the system more maintainable and configurable

### 2. **Better Auto Mode Improvements**
- Fixed temperature sensor discovery
- Added proper shutdown handling
- Improved thermal management logic

### 3. **Frontend Enhancements**
- Made UI operations asynchronous to prevent freezing
- Added automatic socket reconnection
- Reduced polling when window is not visible
- Fixed icon loading with multiple fallback paths

## Technical Improvements

### Backend Changes:
- Added `config.hpp` for centralized configuration
- Added `validation.hpp` for input validation
- Added `logger.hpp` for comprehensive logging
- Removed `set-fan-speed.sh` script (security fix)
- Direct sysfs writes instead of shell commands
- Proper signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- Thread-safe hwmon path caching

### Frontend Changes:
- Asynchronous command execution
- Socket reconnection logic
- Visibility-aware polling
- Proper resource cleanup

## Files Changed

### New Files:
- `backend/src/config.hpp` - Configuration constants
- `backend/src/validation.hpp` - Input validation utilities
- `backend/src/logger.hpp` - Logging infrastructure

### Modified Files:
- `backend/src/main.cpp` - Added validation, logging, signal handling
- `backend/src/fan.cpp` - Removed shell execution, added direct sysfs writes
- `backend/src/util.cpp` - Added caching for hwmon paths
- `frontend/src/socket.cpp` - Added reconnection logic
- `frontend/src/fan.cpp` - Made operations asynchronous
- `frontend/src/about.cpp` - Fixed icon loading
- `backend/victus-control.rules` - Updated permissions
- `install.sh` - Removed script installation

### Deleted Files:
- `backend/src/set-fan-speed.sh` - Removed for security
- `victus-control-sudoers` - No longer needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Testing**:
   - Verify no command injection is possible with malformed inputs
   - Test with extreme values for all inputs
   - Verify permissions work without sudo

2. **Stability Testing**:
   - Test graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C
   - Test backend restart while frontend is running
   - Test with missing hardware/sensors

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Verify reduced CPU usage when window is minimized
   - Check memory usage over extended periods
   - Test with rapid mode/speed changes

## Breaking Changes

- Removed shell script dependency - systems must update udev rules
- Changed permission model - users need to be in victus-backend group
- Removed sudoers configuration

## Migration Guide

1. Remove old sudoers files: `/etc/sudoers.d/victus-*`
2. Remove old script: `/usr/bin/set-fan-speed.sh`
3. Update udev rules with the new version
4. Ensure victus-backend user is in the correct groups

## Future Improvements

1. Add configuration file support for user preferences
2. Implement event-based updates instead of polling
3. Add D-Bus interface for better desktop integration
4. Create unit tests for critical components
5. Add profile support for different fan curves
